# Prework Study Guide Webpage

## Description

This is my first ever project and I created for myself to use as a study guide during the coding bootcamp I'm attending. I built the project in part to learn the very basics of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript and also to refer back to as a study guide. It helped me organize my notes and keep them in a single place. During the making of this project I learned the basics of web development. I learned how to start with a basic structure/outline, and then make it "colorful", and finally make it interactable.

## Usage

This is a study guide, so its purpose is for studying. Each section contains notes of simple things I learned about HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Git. If you open the dev tools console it suggests one of them to study first. If you reload it will suggest a new topic.
